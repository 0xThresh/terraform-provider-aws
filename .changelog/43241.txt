```release-note:enhancement
resource/aws_ecs_service: Remove Terraform default for `availability_zone_rebalancing` to allow ECS to default to `ENABLED` 
for new resources compatible with AvailabilityZoneRebalancing and maintain existing service's AvailabilityZoneRebalancing value 
during updates when not specified. If an existing service never had an AvailabilityZoneRebalancing value set and is updated, ECS
will treat this as `DISABLED`.
